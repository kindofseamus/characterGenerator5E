# Character Generator for 5E
A random NPC/PC generator for 5E that is powered by 5e.tools and OpenAI for a massive library of generation options and ability.

(You can use the script without sending prompts to the AI if you just want random race/class combos powered by 5e.tools)

To use this tool you will need to setup an environment variable using your OpenAI api key which can be found here: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

Once you have your key, follow these instructions:

Windows (PowerShell)
	$env:OPENAI_API_KEY='put-key-here'
	
Mac/Linux (Bash)
	export OPENAI_API_KEY='put-key-here'

Once your key variable is set, run the main.py file to launch the gui and start generating :)
